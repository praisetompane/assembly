def data model:
    - formal: ???

        - in words: ???

    - plain english: ???

    - intuition: assembly's data model is the structure of the CPU's registers and main memory directly.

    - properties:
        - CPU:
            - registers:
                - size|width: defined by the instruction set. either 8-bits, 16-bits, 32-bits, 64-bits.
                        remark:
                            - most modern computers are 64 bits.
                - examples: these are actual register names in x86
                    - rsi
                    - rdi
                    - r8
                    - ...
        - Main memory:
            - 

    - examples: ???
