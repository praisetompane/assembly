Known implementations:
    - Every CPU architecture/family as its own instruction set architecture(ISA):
        - The ISA defines:
            - underlying machine code 
            - the assembly language, which is human readable machine code.
                - often with a one-to-one mapping from assembly to machine code bit strings.
